# Project Mass
This is the first ever public mod developed by me, massacring.
Project Mass is a sci-fi project that for now is meant to add fun blocks, items, gadgets and machines that I personally would like in a sci-fi themed modpack.

NOTE: This is not a space mod, and will most likely never add its own dimension, but I will try to make it extra deeply compatible with ad astra.

The mod name is temporary for now.

There is no ETA for completion (or even a stable release). I will work at my own pace, whenever I get the motivation to.
